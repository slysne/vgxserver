These constants control the ordering of results returned from the various search methods.

A single sort-by constant can be combined with a direction control constant using the bitwise-OR (|) operator.

WARNING: Sort-by constants cannot be combined with other sort-by constants.

== Sort Direction

These constants control the overall direction of the sorted results.

[[sortby_dir_constants]]
[cols="3,7"]
|===
|Sort Constant |Description

|<<S_ASC>>
|Sort ascending, i.e. low to high

|<<S_DESC>>
|Sort descending, i.e. high to low

|===

== Sort By

These constants control how results are ordered.

[[sortby_type_constants]]
[cols="2,1,3,3,2"]
|===
|Sort Constant |Type| Sort by |Description |Default Order

|<<S_NONE>>
|-
|-
|Search results are ordered according to internal traversal. This is generally faster than other sorts.
|undefined

|<<S_VAL>>
|_int_ or _float_
|Arc (predicator) value
|Effective only for methods supporting `arc=` filters.
|Descending

|<<S_ADDR>>
|_int_
|Memory address
|Sort by terminal vertex object's internal memory address. This may lead to faster processing of large search results in some cases.
|Ascending

|<<S_OBID>>
|_str_
|Vertex internalid
|Sort by vertex internalid
|Ascending

|<<S_ID>>
|_str_
|Vertex identifier
|Sort by vertex identifier string
|Ascending

|<<S_DEG>>
|_int_
|Vertex degree
|Sort by vertex total degree (indegree + outdegree)
|Descending

|<<S_IDEG>>
|_int_
|Vertex indegree
|Sort by vertex indegree
|Descending

|<<S_ODEG>>
|_int_
|Vertex outdegree
|Sort by vertex outdegree
|Descending

|<<S_SIM>>
|_float_
|Vertex vector similarity
|Sort by the similarity score computed for terminal vertex vector and probe vector supplied in the query
|Descending

|<<S_HAM>>
|_int_
|Vertex vector fingerprint hamming distance
|Sort by the fingerprint hamming distance for terminal vertex vector and probe vector supplied in the query
|Ascending

|<<S_RANK>>
|_float_
|Generic rank score
|Sort by a rank score as computed by a rank score evaluation function (query dependent feature).

When supported by a query method, the rank scoring specification must be provided in the `rank=` query parameter:

`rank=<rank_spec>`

The `<rank_spec>` syntax depends on the query method.
|Descending

|<<S_TMC>>
|_int_
|Vertex created timestamp
|Sort by vertex creation time (1 second resolution)
|Ascending

|<<S_TMM>>
|_int_
|Vertex modified timestamp
|Sort by vertex modification time (1 second resolution)
|Ascending

|<<S_TMX>>
|_int_
|Vertex expires timestamp
|Sort by vertex expiration time (1 second resolution)
|Ascending

|<<S_NATIVE>>
|_int_
|No sorting
|Similar to <<S_NONE>> but will complete deep traversal to gather counts and other metrics
|undefined

|<<S_RANDOM>>
|_float_
|Random sorting
|The sort order will be randomized. Repeated searches will return a different random sort order each time.
|undefined
