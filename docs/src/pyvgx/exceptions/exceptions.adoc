[[AccessError]]
== pyvgx.AccessError

This exception is raised when sufficient access to a vertex cannot be obtained by a graph operation.

Possible scenarios include:

* The vertex is already locked by another thread
* The vertex is already locked by the current thread and an invalid access mode switch is attempted
* Readonly vertices held by a thread attempting a delete operation
* Repeated locking for the same vertex has reached the recursion limit
* Vertex has been closed and the Python vertex object is no longer valid

Other scenarios are possible. The exception message will provide more details as appropriate.

[[ArcError]]
== pyvgx.ArcError

This exception is raised if an invalid arc specification was used, or if an arc could not be deleted due to acquisition timeout.

[[EnumerationError]]
== pyvgx.EnumerationError

This exception is raised when the core system is unable to perform an enumeration mapping between an external string and the internal integer representation of that string.

Typically, this occurs when the enumeration space becomes exhausted due to too many unique vertex type names or relationship names. Each new unique name string is automatically mapped to a unique integer value for internal use. There is a hard <<../limits.adoc#vgxlimits, limit>> for the number of unique values that can be mapped per graph. The limits are:

* <<../limits.adoc#limits, *208*>> unique _vertex type_ enumerations
* <<../limits.adoc#limits, *15616*>> unique _relationship_ enumerations

When either of these limits is reached, trying to create a new vertex or relationship using a new unique name will raise the exception.

NOTE: These limits apply per graph. Each graph has its own enumeration space.

[[InternalError]]
== pyvgx.InternalError

This exception is raised when an unknown internal error is detected.

[[QueryError]]
== pyvgx.QueryError

This exception is raised when a graph query cannot be completed.

In most cases this is caused by incorrect query parameters.

The exception message will include more details as appropriate.

[[ResultError]]
== pyvgx.ResultError

This exception is raised when a graph query fails to generate a result object. This is typically an internal error.

[[SearchError]]
== pyvgx.SearchError

This exception is raised if the execution of a graph query fails due to an internal error.

[[VertexError]]
== pyvgx.VertexError

This exception is raised when trying to assign an invalid name, type, or other attribute to a vertex.

[[OperationTimeout]]
== pyvgx.OperationTimeout

This exception is raised when a system management operation cannot be completed within a user-specified timeout, or within a system-defined timeout.

[[DataError]]
== pyvgx.DataError

This exception is raised when internal configuration or initialization fails, or when other data corruption is detected.

[[PluginError]]
== pyvgx.PluginError

This exception is raised when execution of an installed plugin could not be performed.

[[RequestError]]
== pyvgx.RequestError

This exception is raised when invalid parameters or data are encountered when processing a PluginRequest instance.

[[ResponseError]]
== pyvgx.ResponseError

This exception is raised when invalid parameters or data are encountered when processing a PluginResponse instance.
